**Agentic RAG model**

Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Agents) is an advanced approach to question answering and information retrieval that leverages the strengths of both large language models (LLMs) and intelligent agents. Here's a breakdown:


**Core Idea:**

* Standard RAG: Retrieves relevant documents based on a user query and then uses an LLM to generate an answer based on those documents.
* Agentic RAG: Introduces a layer of intelligent agents between the LLM and the document retrieval process. These agents can be programmed to:
  - Make decisions about which documents are most relevant.
  - Choose the best retrieval or summarization technique for the specific query.
  - Analyze retrieved information and guide the LLM to generate a more comprehensive and informative response.
  - Interact with multiple documents and perform comparisons or analyses.

**Benefits:**

* Enhanced Accuracy: Agents can filter retrieved information and ensure the LLM focuses on the most relevant parts, leading to more accurate answers.
* Flexibility: Agentic RAG can adapt its approach based on the complexity of the query and the available documents.
* Improved Reasoning: Agents can reason over retrieved information and potentially answer multi-step questions or perform comparisons across documents.
* Reduced Cost and Latency: By guiding the LLM efficiently, agentic RAG can potentially reduce the computational resources required and improve response times.
